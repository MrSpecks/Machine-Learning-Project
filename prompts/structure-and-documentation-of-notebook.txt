The housing_eda_kagiso_mfusi.ipynb notebook contains extensive exploratory data analysis and feature engineering on the Ames Housing dataset (@housing_eda_kagiso_mfusi.ipynb), focusing on SalePrice drivers.

The current analysis is excellent. The goal now is to refactor this notebook into a modular, production-ready state to serve as the "backend" for a Streamlit dashboard. We will keep all the same core analyses and graphs but improve the structure, documentation, and modularity.

Review the existing notebook and identify:

What key property metrics are currently analyzed (e.g., price drivers, correlations, neighborhood stats)?

What visualizations are created (e.g., scatter plots, box plots, heatmaps)?

What data transformations and feature engineering steps are performed (e.g., TotalSF, QualitySize, log transforms)?

Any code that could be converted into a reusable function.

Refactoring Requirements

Notebook Structure & Documentation

Add a clear Table of Contents.

Organize the notebook into logical sections with proper markdown headers and explanations:

Introduction & Project Objectives: State the goal (analyze Ames housing data, prep for dashboard).

Data Loading & Configuration: Central cell for loading data and setting parameters.

Data Preparation & Feature Engineering: Document the steps to clean data and create the 50+ engineered features.

Key Metric & Relationship Analysis: This section should cover the core findings from the notebook:

Price Driver Analysis (e.g., OverallQual, GrLivArea)

Neighborhood & Location Analysis (e.g., price variance by area)

Key Feature Correlation Analysis (using the engineered features)

Outlier Investigation

Summary of Observations & Modeling Readiness: Conclude with key takeaways.

Include a Data Dictionary explaining key original features (OverallQual, GrLivArea, Neighborhood) and key engineered features (TotalSF, TotalBath, QualitySize).

Code Quality Improvements

Create reusable Python functions with clear docstrings (e.g., def load_data(...), def engineer_features(df, ...), def plot_price_vs_size(df, ...)).

Implement consistent variable naming and formatting.

Create separate Python files to modularize the code:

housing_data_loader.py: A module containing functions to:

Load the train.csv data.

Perform any necessary (though minimal) cleaning.

Execute all feature engineering steps to create the 50+ new features.
This file should have a main function that returns a "master" analysis-ready DataFrame.

housing_analysis_metrics.py: A module containing business logic/calculation functions only (e.g., get_top_correlations(df, target), calculate_neighborhood_stats(df), get_median_price_by_quality(df)).

Enhanced Visualizations

Ensure all plots (especially those intended for the dashboard) have:

Clear and descriptive titles (e.g., "Sale Price Increases with Overall Quality").

Proper axis labels with units (e.g., "Sale Price ($)", "Above-Grade Living Area (SqFt)").

Legends where needed (e.g., for different neighborhoods).

Appropriate chart types (e.g., box plots for Neighborhood, scatter for GrLivArea).

Consistent, professional color schemes.

Configuration Analysis Framework

The current notebook analyzes the entire dataset. Refactor the code in the notebook (and the new .py modules) so that the core analysis functions can accept a pre-filtered DataFrame.

This will allow the future Streamlit dashboard to pass data filtered by Neighborhood, OverallQual, YearBuilt, or YrSold to these functions to get dynamic metrics and plots.

Deliverables Expected

Refactored Jupyter Notebook (Housing_EDA_Refactored.ipynb) with all improvements.

Data loading/engineering module (housing_data_loader.py) with documented functions.

Analysis/metrics module (housing_analysis_metrics.py) with documented functions.

A requirements.txt file listing all dependencies (pandas, numpy, seaborn, sklearn, etc.).

A README section explaining how to run the refactored notebook.
